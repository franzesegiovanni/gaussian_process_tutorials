## This is a collection of tutorials developed by Giovanni Franzese during his PhD in Cognitive Robotics, TU Delft.
These tutorials are mainly educational and are not necessarily connected to publications. 

Some of the notebooks are commented. Some others could be more commented on. 

Not all notebooks have a related publication because some ideas were developed for understanding or educational purposes more than for pure research. 

If you find these notebooks insightful, please follow me, ask questions about the issue, or message me at g.franzese@tudelft.nl.
